# B20 Asset

The Asset variant of B20 — designed for assets of all kinds. Everything in [B20/README.md](README.md) applies; this page covers the deltas only. See [`IB20Asset`](../../src/interfaces/IB20Asset.sol) for the full Solidity interface.

## Multiplier

Each account's stored balance is the **raw** balance. A uniform on-chain **multiplier** scales that raw balance into a derived **scaled** view that consumers display. The multiplier applies to all accounts equally, which lets issuers rebase every balance at once — without rewriting individual balances — the shape is similar to wstETH wrapping stETH, where the stored unit is the unwrapped quantity and the derived unit is the rebased view. Because it only rescales the *displayed* balance, the multiplier is purely cosmetic: `balanceOf`, `transfer`, and `totalSupply` stay raw, so raw-denominated venues (AMMs, etc.) are mechanically unaffected by an update.

Read the current multiplier with `multiplier()`; the value is in WAD precision (`1e18`, exposed as `WAD_PRECISION()`). `toScaledBalance(rawBalance)` converts a raw amount to its scaled view, `toRawBalance(scaledBalance)` is the reverse converter (integer-floored, so the round-trip can lose up to one ULP), and `scaledBalanceOf(account)` is a convenience over ERC-20's `balanceOf` that returns the same account's raw balance in its scaled form.

Both multiplier setters validate `newMultiplier` is non-zero and at most `type(uint128).max` (reverting `InvalidMultiplier` otherwise). The `uint128` ceiling is the overflow guard: with supply capped at `type(uint128).max`, a `uint128` multiplier keeps `balance * multiplier` inside `uint256`, so balance-derived reads never overflow.

### Scheduling multiplier updates

The standard path for a corporate action (a stock split or reinvested stock dividend) is to **schedule** the change ahead of time with `setUIMultiplier(newMultiplier, effectiveAt)`, wrapped in an [announcement](#announcements). Evaluation is lazy, so `multiplier()` / `uiMultiplier()` flip on their own once `block.timestamp` reaches `effectiveAt`.

Only **one pending update is live at a time**. Attempting to schedule over an existing pending update reverts `ScheduleOverlap`. To reorder overlapping corporate actions, explicitly cancel and re-schedule in a single announcement bracket using `announce([cancelScheduledMultiplier, setUIMultiplier(...)])`. `cancelScheduledMultiplier()` clears the live pending and restores the no-pending state (reverting `NoScheduledMultiplier` when nothing live is scheduled).

`updateMultiplier(newMultiplier)` is retained as an **instant failsafe / emergency override**: it sets the multiplier immediately, stamping `effectiveAt = block.timestamp` and clearing any pending update.

The pending schedule is observable through the ERC-8056 surface: `newUIMultiplier()` returns the scheduled target while it is live (otherwise it mirrors `uiMultiplier()`).

### ERC-8056 conformance

The Asset variant conforms to [ERC-8056](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8056) ("Scaled UI Amount"):

- `uiMultiplier()` is the standard alias of `multiplier()` (core interface `0xa60bf13d`).
- `newUIMultiplier()` / `effectiveAt()` expose the pending schedule (required extension `0x4bd27648`).
- `balanceOfUI(account)` aliases `scaledBalanceOf`, and `totalSupplyUI()` returns `totalSupply() * uiMultiplier() / 1e18` (optional Balances extension `0xd890fd71`).
- `supportsInterface(bytes4)` (ERC-165, `0x01ffc9a7`) returns `true` for those three IDs and for ERC-165 itself. The optional Conversion extension (`0x57854fc3`) is **not** claimed — the native `toScaledBalance` / `toRawBalance` names are kept unaliased for backwards compatibility.

**Events.** Every multiplier change emits `UIMultiplierUpdated(oldMultiplier, newMultiplier, effectiveAtTimestamp)` — from `setUIMultiplier` and from `updateMultiplier`. `MultiplierUpdateCancelled(cancelledMultiplier, cancelledEffectiveAt)` is emitted by `cancelScheduledMultiplier` and by `updateMultiplier` when it clears a live pending. The optional ERC-8056 `TransferWithUIAmount` event is intentionally omitted — scaled balances are derivable from the raw `Transfer` and the active multiplier.

### Precision & decimals

All multiplier-derived reads (`toScaledBalance` / `scaledBalanceOf` / `totalSupplyUI` divide by `WAD_PRECISION`; `toRawBalance` divides by the multiplier) round **down**, and raw balances are never rewritten. This guarantees that rounding loss is rare and confined to the scaled view (and to `toRawBalance` conversions). In the rare case where rounding loss occurs, the loss cannot exceed 1 wei of the *scaled* amount only. 

**Thus, prefer 18 decimals for equities**: at 6 decimals, a deep reverse split on a very valuable stock could make 1-wei floor dust economically visible; at 18 it stays noise

### Pause & market-halt policy

Because a multiplier update is value-neutral to raw venues, forward splits and reinvested dividends need no halt on-chain. A reverse split, however, warrants halting via `PausableFeature.TRANSFER` across the flip window so trading windows are paused and re-enabled in orderly fashion. The instant `updateMultiplier` bypasses the scheduling window entirely, so it should likewise be pause-bracketed.

## Announcements

Announcements are publicly viewable notifications posted by a token operator. They can represent anything the operator wants to create a record of and can be coupled with actual state changes on the token (updating the multiplier, batched mints, and so on).

### Event Topology

An announcement is delimited by a paired `Announcement(msg.sender, id, description, uri)` event (opens the bracket) and `EndAnnouncement(id)` event (closes it). Every state-changing call dispatched inside the bracket belongs to that announcement. A recursion guard prevents nesting, and each `id` is enforced unique forever (`AnnouncementIdAlreadyUsed`) so indexers can correlate brackets across transactions.

Indexers should treat every `Announcement` log as the start of exactly one bracket; effects between `Announcement` and `EndAnnouncement` belong to the announced action; effects emitted *without* a surrounding bracket are direct invocations and should be flagged as emergency overrides.

### Wrapping calls in announcements

Wrap a set of operations in a single announcement by calling `announce(internalCalls, id, description, uri)`. The function (gated by `OPERATOR_ROLE`) emits `Announcement`, dispatches each internal call via self-`delegatecall` (which preserves `msg.sender` so the inner role checks see the operator), then emits `EndAnnouncement`. Inner reverts are wrapped in `InternalCallFailed` rather than bubbled — replay the call directly to debug. Nested calls to `announce` revert with `AnnouncementInProgress`; calls shorter than 4 bytes revert with `InternalCallMalformed`.

```solidity
// Disclose and schedule a 2:1 forward split, effective at the ex-date.
bytes[] memory internalCalls = new bytes[](1);
internalCalls[0] = abi.encodeCall(IB20Asset.setUIMultiplier, (2e18, exDateTimestamp));

IB20Asset(token).announce({
    internalCalls: internalCalls,
    id: "2026-Q3-split",
    description: "2:1 forward split, effective at ex-date",
    uri: "https://disclosures.example.com/..."
});
```

## Batch Mint

`batchMint(recipients, amounts)` mints to many accounts in one call, gated by `MINT_ROLE`. It should be wrapped in `announce()`, which additionally requires the operator to hold `OPERATOR_ROLE` (typically granted as a single bundle).

## Extra Metadata

Each Asset token can carry an arbitrary set of named metadata entries — a general-purpose key/value store the issuer is free to use however they want (e.g. `"category"` → `"electronics"`, `"region"` → `"north-america"`, `"reference"` → `"REF-2024-001"`). Read with `extraMetadata(key)`; the value is a `string`. All entries are optional and added post-creation — the factory does not seed any entry at token creation.

`updateExtraMetadata(key, value)` adds, updates, or removes an entry, gated by `METADATA_ROLE` (the same role that gates `updateName` / `updateSymbol`). It does NOT require `OPERATOR_ROLE` and can be invoked directly without an `announce()` wrapper. Passing an empty `value` removes the entry. An empty `key` reverts with `InvalidMetadataKey`.

## Additional roles

### `OPERATOR_ROLE`

Gates `announce`, `setUIMultiplier`, `cancelScheduledMultiplier`, and `updateMultiplier`. These are metadata-like operations — they post disclosures and rescale the displayed balance rather than moving raw balances directly — but a compromised operator carries materially higher severity than ordinary metadata edits, so the capability is elevated into its own independent role instead of being folded into `METADATA_ROLE`. Held separately from `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` so operators don't need full admin authority.

## Configurable Decimals

`decimals()` is chosen at creation via `B20AssetCreateParams.decimals` and immutable thereafter. The factory enforces the inclusive range `[6, 18]` (exposed as `B20Constants.MIN_ASSET_DECIMALS` and `MAX_ASSET_DECIMALS`); out-of-range values revert `InvalidDecimals(decimals)`. `6` is the smallest unit any asset should use and `18` is a reasonable ceiling that encompasses the supermajority of assets.
