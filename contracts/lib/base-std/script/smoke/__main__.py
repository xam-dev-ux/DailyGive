"""CLI: python -m smoke <journey> [<journey> ...] [-k]

Journeys: factory, asset, multiplier, stablecoin, seize, policy, invariants — or `all` to run
every journey in sequence. Env (RPC_URL / DEPLOYER_PK / USER2_PK) is sourced by the
Makefile from .env; running directly requires it exported. A preflight liveness
probe checks the b20 precompiles are actually active on the target chain (fork
>= Beryl); if not, the journey is skipped rather than reporting environment state
(inactive feature → account-state fall-through) as contract defects.

Flags:
  -k, --keep-going   Run every selected journey even if one fails, print a summary,
                     and exit 0 regardless of failures. Without it the suite fails
                     fast and exits non-zero on the first failure (the default,
                     suitable for CI gating).
